# RDF_GraphCreation
This project corresponds to the master’s research project. Hence, it will have its own grade (3 ECTS). The project spans across the Symbolic AI and Reasoning) (SAIR) and Data Engineer courses. We will dedicate some lab sessions to it but you will also have to spend some additional time to complete the different implementation steps. Considering the SAIR course, your project group needs to create some RDF data sets on people who have been vaccined for covid-19. You will also generate information about side effects witnessed for these persons. You will generate SPARQL queries to conduct some analysis over these data. You will use and create a set of ontologies associated to the information and knowledge stored in these data sets. During the Data Engineer’s course, you will submit the side effects information to the Apache Kafka commit log, run some “real-time” analysis with Spark’s structured streaming, and display some visualization.
